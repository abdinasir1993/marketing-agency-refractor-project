### Screenshot
![](./screenshot.jpg)
Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select “Take a Screenshot”. You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it’s very long, it might be best to crop it.
Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don’t need to purchase it.
Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.
**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**
